HELP,PIEZ

 Piezoele:  Piezoelectric materials.

    Piezoelectric capability allows coupling between the
 structural and electric fields for the SOLID5, PLANE13, and
 SOLID98 coupled-field elements.  Material properties required
 for the piezoelectric effects include the stiffness constants,
 the piezoelectric constants, and the dielectric constants.

    The dielectric constants are input as the usual linear
 material properties (PERX, PERY, PERZ).  The elastic coefficient
 matrix (commonly referred to as the "c" matrix evaluated at a
 constant electric field) may be input either by specifying the
 stiffness constants (EX, EY, etc.) by means of the usual linear
 property commands or by specifying the terms of the matrix by
 means of the data table commands.  The matrix is symmetric,
 positive definite (requiring all determinants to be positive).

   Elastic Coefficient        : c11                          :
   Matrix ("c" matrix)        : c21  c22         Symmetric   :

 See Piezo_2 and Piezo_3 for more on piezoelectric materials.


HELP,PIEZo_2

  Piezo_2:  More on piezoelectric materials - "c" matrix input.

    The 6 x 6 elastic coefficient matrix relates terms ordered
 x,y,z,xy,yz,xz via 21 constants as shown below.  The constants
 of the matrix are entered in the data table with the TB
 commands.  The constant table is initialized by using Lab=ANEL
 on the TB command.  The 21 constants are defined with the TBDATA
 commands.  The constants (C1-C21) entered on the TBDATA commands
 (6 per command) are as follows:
                                     1    2    3    4    5    6

                               3  :  3    8   12
  For example, "c" matrix      4  :  4    9   13   16
  term c42 is entered as       5  :  5   10   14   17   19
  constant C9.                 6  :  6   11   15   18   20   21

    The matrix can be defined (KEYOPT(2)) in either "stiffness"
 form (operating on the strain vector) or in "compliance" form
 (operating on the stress vector and is commonly referred to as
 the "d" matrix evaluated at a constant electric field),
 whichever is more convenient.

 See Piezo_3 for more on piezoelectric materials.


HELP,PIEZo_3

  Piezo_3:  More on piezoelectric materials - "e" matrix input.
    The piezoelectric matrix (commonly referred to as the "e"
 matrix) is a full 6 x 3 matrix relating terms x,y,z,xy,yz,xz to
 x,y,z via 18 constants as shown above.  Note, the order of the
 vectors in ANSYS is {x,y,z,xy,yz,xz}, while for most published
 piezoelectric material the order is {x,y,z,yz,xz,xy}.  This
 difference will require the "c" and "e" matrix terms to be
 converted to the ANSYS format.  The constants of the matrix are
 entered in the data table with the TB commands.  The constant
 table is initialized by using Lab=PIEZ on the TB command.
 The 18 constants are defined with the TBDATA commands.
 The constants (C1-C18) entered on the TBDATA commands (6 per
 command) are as follows:

     Piezoelectric               to "e" matrix terms.

 3.  An axisymmetric structure should be modeled in the +X
     quadrants.
 4.  For structural problems, extra displaced shapes are
     automatically deleted for triangular elements so that a
     constant strain element results.

 5.  Magnetic material properties are assumed to be isotropic.

 6.  Transient magnetic analysis with nonlinear material
     properties should be performed in a Nonlinear Transient
     Dynamic (ANTYPE=4) analysis.

 7.  An electro-magnetic analysis (where eddy current formation
     is permitted in conducting regions with applied current
     loading) is performed by using KEYOPT(1)=6, specifying a
     conductivity, and coupling volt DOF's for those elements.
