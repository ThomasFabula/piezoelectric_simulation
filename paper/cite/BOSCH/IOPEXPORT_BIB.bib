abstract = {This paper presents a resonant force sensor comprising piezoelectric ZnO thin-film transducers for excitation and detection of resonant beam vibrations. A short description of the processing technique is given, i.e. deposition and passivation of the ZnO layer and separation of beam structures. The electrical behaviour of the sensor was optimized by patterning ZnO areas to minimize electrical crosstalk effects.}
