Finite Element Modeling 
The design and fabrication cycles of sensor devices can be considerably reduced and time-economized by utilizing computer simulations.
In addition modeling provides an unique insight into the functioning of resonant microsensors. Numerical methods like finite element 
analyses (FEA) are powerful tools to model the dynamical response of resonant sensors and to predict the performance of the sensor 
device under changing operating conditions. The static and dynamic behaviour of bulk resonant force and pressure sensors were 
calculated with the general-purpose finite element code ANSYS [SASI] in order to optimize the sensor performance. Modal analyses 
were used to solve the eigenvalue problem by which the resonance frequencies and flexure vibration mode shapes of beams and 
diaphragms are determined. Combination of static and subsequent modal analysis allows to calculate the load-dependent frequency 
shifts of resonant sensors. Utilizing this technique the pressure-deflection and pressure-frequency characteristics of silicon 
diaphragm pressure sensors were investigated and optimized [Fab92].

Force sensor
Modeling the dynamical behaviour of the silicon beam force sensor the piezoelectric thin films were neglected in a first approach. 
The flexural resonance frequencies of silicon beams can be calculated with satisfactory approximation also by analytical methods. 
The fundamental resonance frequency of doubly clamped, homogeneous beams with thickness t and length l is given by [Wea90]:
f_1~=~ 1.028~t over l sup 2~sqrt{E over {(1 - ny^2)ρ}}The material behaviour of silicon is assumed to be isotropic, where 
E = 168,9 GPa is the Young's modulus and ν = 0,063 is the Poisson's ratio in the <110> crystal direction. The material density 
of silicon is ρ = 2329 kg/m³ at room temperature. The resonance frequency of the first flexural overtone f2 is approximately 
2.7566 times the fundamental frequency f1 [Bou91]. The analytically and numerically calculated resonance frequencies of 
a 6 mm long, 400 μm width and 50 μm thick silicon beam are compared with experimental data in table 1. The finite element 
model consists of 1024 eight-node 3-D elements considering the clamping region defined by the silicon (111)-crystal planes. 
The frequency ratio f2/f1 of the numerically calculated frequencies is 2.757 in satisfactory agreement with the experimental 
data (...???, Lärmer). The difference in the absolute frequency values is mainly due to intrinsic residual stress of the 
additional piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films, which will be discussed further.

For mode selective excitation and detection of the resonator vibrations, the stress patterns on the resonator surface has to 
be estimated, in order to choose the appropriate electrode locations. For this purpose a linear harmonic response analysis 
was carried out to calculate the frequency response of a silicon beam. In the upper part (a) of Figure 1 the numerically 
calculated transverse beam displacements for the first and second flexural vibration modes are shown. Due to the linear 
model behaviour the vibration amplitudes are proportional to the exciting force.  A central mechanical force of 10-4 N was 
assumed leading to a maximum displacement of approximately 6 μm for the fundamental vibration mode. The maximum amplitudes 
of the second overtone are approximately 14 times smaller. A uniform damping ratio of 10-3 was assumed for the whole 
frequency range 10-35 kHz. In the middle part (b) of figure 1 the silicon beam force sensor is schematically illustrated 
with the clamping defined by the (111)-crystal planes. The whole sensor device is fixed along the bottom side of the bulk 
region. The lower part (c) exhibits the axial stress distribution on the surface of the resonator beam. The first flexure 
vibration mode shows compressive stress areas near the clamping regions (1.8 % of l) and a central tensile stress area 
corresponding to the displacement plot in figure 1 (a). The second flexure vibration mode shows two alternating compressive 
and two tensile stress areas. In the middle section of the beam at approximately ± 1.3 mm (29% of l) from the center 
(beam coordinate: 4.34 mm) two wide spread stress areas occur with opposite signs (compressive and tensile stress). 
In order to obtain a mode-selective excitation, the second vibration mode has to be suppressed. This can be achieved 
by placing two electrodes in the middle section of the beam and applying the same potential to them as described in 
chapter xx (Funk).

Pressure sensor
The resonant pressure sensor under consideration consists of a silicon diaphragm with 9.2 mm side length and 50 μm thickness 
comprising a 11 μm thick ZnO layer for piezoelectric excitation and detection. The diaphragm deflection is calculated by 
performing a non-linear analysis with the Newton-Raphson equation solver considering stress stiffening and large deflection 
effects [Koh92]. The static solution provides a load-dependent stiffness matrix of the whole sensor structure which is 
used in a subsequent modal analysis to determine the frequency shifts. Several FE-models were used to investigate the 
influence of isotropic and anisotropic material behaviour, different element types, number of master degrees of freedom 
(MDOF) and the boundary conditions. 

FE-model (A) uses 4-node 2-D plastic shell elements (SHELL43) and consists of 400 elements with 441 nodes and 100 MDOF. 
Material data are weighted through the different layer thicknesses of silicon and ZnO resulting in mean values for Young's 
modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density  of 161 GPa, 0.1166 and 2932 kg/m³, respectively. Ideal clamping of the diaphragm is
assumed as boundary conditions. FE-model (B) uses 20-node 3-D solid elements (SOLID95) and consists of 944 elements with 
5521 nodes and 500 MDOF. The material behaviour is assumed to be isotropic for both, silicon and the ZnO-layer. For ZnO 
a Young's modulus of 126 GPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.36 and density of 5675 kg/m³ is used. Indenter measurements on 
ZnO thin films (2-3 μm) result in a reduced Young's modulus E/(1-ν2) of approximately 145 GPa [Fab93]. The FE-model 
comprises the real clamping geometry defined by the (111)-crystal planes. FE-model (C) uses 8-node 3-D solid elements 
(SOLID64) and consists of 3844 elements with 5230 nodes and 500 MDOF. The material behaviour is assumed to be anisotropic 
for both materials and bulk data is taken from [LB82]. The FE-model comprises 4 element layers over the diaphragm thickness 
and the real clamping geometry. The long dashed lines denote the results of model (A), short dashed lines denote model (B) 
and solid lines denote model (C) in figures 2 and 3, respectively. Due to the pressure loading of 500 mbar a maximum 
stress on the diaphragm surface in the region of 90-100 MPa at diaphragm center occurs. The membrane stress within the
diaphragm middle (SHELL-model) was estimated to be approximately 34 MPa.
In Figure 2 the numerically calculated and measured pressure-deflection characteristics of the sensor device is shown.
The measured values are denoted in each diagram (figure 2 and 3) with a star symbol. Due to non-linear effects membrane
stresses occur in the diaphragm leading to a degressive pressure-deflection characteristics. In Figure 3 the results of 
the numerically calculated and measured pressure-frequency characteristics for the fundamental flexure mode are shown.
The results are summarized in Table 2. Comparing measured data with the numerical results show a relative error of 2-7% 
in resonance frequencies f0, 6-19 % in center diaphragm deflection UZ and up to 24 % in pressure sensitivity df0/dp
indicating a too stiff model behaviour. If greater model inaccuracies can be excluded, the deviations of the numerical
results are either due to the intrinsic residual stress in the ZnO-layer, the unknown material properties of thin film 
ZnO and probably a non homogeneous diaphragm thickness. The decreased experimental pressure sensitivity of approximately 
12 kHz/bar is obviously caused by residual stress in the composite diaphragm.
